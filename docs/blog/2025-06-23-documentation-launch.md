We're excited to announce the launch of the new Variant-Linker documentation website! Built with Docusaurus, our new docs provide comprehensive guides, API references, and examples to help you get the most out of Variant-Linker.

## What's New

### ðŸŽ¯ Organized Structure
The documentation is now organized into clear sections:
- **Getting Started** - Installation and basic usage
- **Guides** - In-depth tutorials for specific features
- **API Reference** - Auto-generated from JSDoc comments
- **Benchmarking** - Performance testing and optimization

### ðŸ“– Comprehensive Guides
We've created detailed guides covering:
- VCF and PED file handling
- Inheritance pattern analysis
- Custom scoring engine configuration
- Best practices and troubleshooting

### âš¡ Auto-Generated API Documentation
Using TypeDoc integration, our API documentation is automatically generated from the source code comments, ensuring it stays up-to-date with every release.

### ðŸ”„ Automated Deployment
