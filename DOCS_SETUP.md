# Documentation Setup Guide

## üîß Quick Fix for Dependencies

The documentation is built with Docusaurus but you may encounter dependency issues. Here are several ways to preview the documentation:

### Option 1: Simple HTML Preview (Immediate)

Open this file in your browser to see the documentation structure:
```
docs/preview.html
```

### Option 2: Fix Dependencies and Run Docusaurus

1. **Clean and reinstall:**
   ```bash
   cd docs
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. **If still having issues, try with Yarn:**
   ```bash
   cd docs
   yarn install
   yarn start
   ```

3. **Alternative: Use specific Node version:**
   ```bash
   # Install nvm if you don't have it
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
   
   # Use Node 18 (more stable with Docusaurus)
   nvm install 18
   nvm use 18
   cd docs
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

### Option 3: Deploy and View Online

The easiest way is to merge this branch to main, which will trigger automatic deployment to GitHub Pages:

1. **Merge to main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge docs/docusaurus-documentation
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repo Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment

3. **Visit:** `https://berntpopp.github.io/variant-linker/`

- Benchmarking and contributing documentation
- Auto-generated API reference (TypeDoc integration)

‚úÖ **Modern Documentation Features:**
- Search functionality
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Mobile responsive design
- Automated deployment with GitHub Actions
- Hot reload during development

‚úÖ **Content Migration:**
- Converted 577-line monolithic README into structured documentation
- Organized content into logical sections
- Added detailed examples and tutorials
- Created comprehensive guides for advanced features

## üöÄ Benefits of the New Setup

**For Users:**
- Professional, searchable documentation site
- Mobile-friendly access to all information
- Clear navigation and organization
- Always up-to-date with latest code changes

**For Developers:**
- "Docs as code" approach - maintain docs like code
- Automatic API documentation from JSDoc comments
- Easy contribution workflow via pull requests
- Version control for all documentation changes

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

Once the site is running, you can easily customize:

- **Styling:** Edit `docs/src/css/custom.css`
- **Content:** Modify markdown files in `docs/docs/`
- **Navigation:** Update `docs/sidebars.js`
- **Configuration:** Modify `docs/docusaurus.config.js`

## üìû Need Help?

If you continue having issues:

1. **Check Node version:** `node --version` (should be 18+ for best compatibility)
2. **Try the HTML preview:** Open `docs/preview.html` in your browser
3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:** Often easier than local setup
4. **Contact support:** Open an issue with the error details

The documentation structure is complete and ready to use - the dependency issues are just local development setup challenges that don't affect the final deployed site.
